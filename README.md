# SinkCam
## A CMIO Camera extension that is an output device for a sink stream from its container app

There are three major kinds of CMIO Camera Extensions: **software camera**, **creative camera**, and **output device**. [OffcutsCam](http://github.com/Halle/OffcutsCam) and [TechnicalDifficulties](http://github.com/Halle/TechnicalDifficulties) are examples of **software cameras** (all content generated inside the extension), [ArtFilm](http://github.com/Halle/ArtFilm) is an example of a **creative camera** (modifies a feed originating from another camera) and this is an example of an **output device**, where the camera extension shows software camera content (the same ascending and descending white line content as OffcutsCam) until the container app is run, at which time the container app streams its own `AVCaptureSession` feed from the continuity camera into the CMIO Camera Extension. 

I wanted to thank [Laurent Denoue](https://github.com/ldenoue) again for providing a [reference example](https://github.com/ldenoue/cameraextension) of this type of `CMIOExtensionStreamSource` and how it can be addressed by the app.

If you want to give it a try, it is necessary for you to change all references to my team ID and organization ID to yours (this occurs in a few places) or it will not be possible for you to codesign and install. This can only be run on a Ventura beta or later (at the time of this writing, there was no general release of Ventura yet), and if you want to use the continuity camera, you also need iOS 16 on your phone.

This is part 3.5 ðŸ˜… of my three-part series on CMIO Camera Extensions on [The Offcuts](https://www.theoffcuts.org)
