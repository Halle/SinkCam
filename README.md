# SinkCam
## A CMIO Camera extension that is an output device for a sink stream from its container app

There are three major kinds of CMIO Camera Extensions: **software camera**, **creative camera**, and **output device**. [OffcutsCam](http://github.com/Halle/OffcutsCam) and [TechnicalDifficulties](http://github.com/Halle/TechnicalDifficulties) are examples of software cameras (all content generated inside the extension), [ArtFilm](http://github.com/Halle/ArtFilm) is an example of a creative camera (modifies a feed originating from another camera) and this is an example of an output device, where the camera extension shows software camera content (the same ascending and descending white line content as OffcutsCam) until the container app is run, at which time the container app streams its own `AVCaptureSession` feed into the CMIO Camera Extension. I wanted to thank [Laurent Denoue](https://github.com/ldenoue) again for providing a [reference example](https://github.com/ldenoue/cameraextension) of this type of `CMIOExtensionStreamSource` and how it can be addressed by the app.
